  // (swarm-provider-ipc, feed-service, stamp-service, publish-service,
  // feed-store, swarm-permissions, origin-utils) but a lot of renderer
  // UI glue (stamp-manager, publish-setup, node-status, balance-display)

  // Pre-Swarm levels were 42/33/43/42; they were lowered to 40/33/40/41
  // in 38b07f3 to unblock CI when the UI modules landed. Follow-up:
  // either add renderer UI tests (via jsdom + DOM fixtures) to recover
  // the old global thresholds, or switch to per-path thresholds that
  // enforce high coverage on main-process service code while accepting
  // lower coverage on renderer UI.
