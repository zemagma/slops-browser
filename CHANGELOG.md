# Changelog

All notable changes to Freedom will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ethereum:` URI scheme (EIP-681) routes to the wallet sidebar's Send screen with recipient, chain, and amount pre-filled. Lets any page offer a "Tip author" link like `<a href="ethereum:vitalik.eth@1?value=1e16">` — no wallet connection required. Native-asset sends only in this release; ERC-20 and other contract-call variants are rejected explicitly.

### Changed

- Wallet send: recipient field now accepts ENS names (`.eth`, `.box`, subdomains). The name is resolved to its `addr` record on mainnet when you press Continue, and the review screen shows both the name and the resolved address so you can verify before confirming.
- Wallet send screen now honors the chain selected on the main wallet view instead of defaulting to the first chain with a balance.

### Fixed

- dApp-connect wallet picker dropdown no longer shows through to the content below (had an undefined CSS variable in both themes).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- Experimental support for Radicle (decentralized Git hosting) on macOS and Linux:
  - Enable or disable Radicle from Settings > Experimental
  - `rad://` URL handling across navigation and rewriting
  - Bundled Radicle node lifecycle management and packaging support
  - Integrated repo browser page and GitHub-to-Radicle import bridge
  - Automatic seeding of Freedom's canonical Radicle repository when running the bundled node
- Swarm encrypted reference support in navigation and URL rewriting (including 64- and 128-character hex references)

### Fixed

- `Cmd/Ctrl+L` now reliably focuses the address bar even when web content has focus
- Pressing `Cmd/Ctrl+L` and `Escape` now consistently closes open menus and clears stale focus highlights
- Pinned tabs can no longer be closed through keyboard-accelerator close-tab actions

### Security

- Validate protocol-specific identifiers in IPC handlers and URL rewriting to block malformed or malicious input

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-08

First public open-source release.

### Added

- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn to switch tabs, Ctrl+Shift+PgUp/PgDn to reorder tabs, Ctrl+F4 to close tab, Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen closed tabs, Ctrl+Shift+B to toggle bookmark bar, F11 for fullscreen, F12 for devtools
- Bookmark bar toggle that persists to settings and always shows on new tab page
- About panel with version, copyright, credits, website, and app icon
- DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers (Cloudflare DoH, eth.limo) for reliable dnsaddr and DNSLink resolution
- ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig for consistent code formatting

### Changed

- Split reload into soft (Ctrl+R, uses cache) and hard (Ctrl+Shift+R, bypasses cache); toolbar reload button defaults to soft, Shift+click for hard
- Switch IPFS content discovery from DHT to delegated routing via cid.contact

### Fixed

- Address bar staying focused after selecting autocomplete suggestion
- Unreadable pages in dark mode — inject light background/text defaults for external pages that don't support dark mode
- ENS resolution reliability: replace broken RPC providers (llamarpc, ankr, cloudflare-eth → drpc, blastapi, merkle) and fix failed handle cleanup
- View-source address bar and title not updating correctly
- IPFS routing and DNSLink resolution on networks with broken or slow local DNS

### Security

- Add Content Security Policy headers to all internal HTML pages
- Validate IPFS CID format, IPNS names, and block malformed `bzz://` requests
- Harden webview preferences, restrict `freedomAPI` to internal pages only, tighten local API CORS and IPC base URLs, redact logged URLs
- Resolve all npm audit vulnerabilities (11 total: 10 high, 1 moderate)
- Updated dependencies: Electron 39→40, electron-builder 26.0→26.7, better-sqlite3 12.5→12.6, electron-updater 6.6→6.7
